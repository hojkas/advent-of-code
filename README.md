# Advent of Code

My attempts at solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

Due to the nature of the advent of code as small one-time puzzles, my solutions are at times not following all clean code practises and I am aware of that. Don't hold it against me if I did not stuck around on each day to clean up :)
